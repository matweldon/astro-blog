Social media are meme markets. I already thought this, but the other day I realised I was reading an article about the cost of Higher Education in the US -- a topic which is fairly irrelevant to me -- and it occurred to me that social media was curating the issues I spend brain power on. The issues people spend brain power on are the memes that rise to the top of the meme digester which is social media.

A framework to think about social media:

* small bundles of **content** (memes) created by an **account**
* Users **share** and **rate** (i.e. vote on) content, or create content in reply to it
* Users can be linked together in a (usually asymmetric) social network explicitly (through friend/follow relationships), or implicitly (by interacting with each other's content)
* The content each user sees is **curated**, by an algorithm that may take into account expressed and revealed preferences, searches, the social network, likes and shares, advertising, the goals of the app maker etc.
* There are norms and practices for interaction, which may be guided by the app but also often evolve in a decentralised way. They evolve at an accelerated rate compared to norms offline
* Content delivers memes: it's probably possible to categorise memes into different types, but one important type for political practice is **issues**. An issue is a meme that brings attention to a social problem, perhaps also mixed in with ideas about the causes of the problem and solutions

These are the most important parameters of social media: content; network; curation; voting.

What this has to do with power is obvious: there are two main ways that actors can use power outside social media to gain power within it:

* Manipulating the curation mechanism (e.g. by controlling the app)
* Paying for real/bot accounts (footsoldiers; droids) to create content

But we shouldn't overstate the influence of powerful actors in practice: although they are undoubtedly doing their best to influence social media, it does appear that the dissemination of memes is still out of anyone's direct control.

The memes are in charge.

So then the question is, are there any 'truth-biased' designs for social media that will tend to reinforce truthy memes and limit untruthy ones?

In the case of markets there are some markets that tend towards bubbles -- namely asset markets. Rental markets (eg. labour markets) don't lead to bubbles.

### How to make meme markets less like asset markets

The key property of an asset market that makes it unstable is that you can buy an asset not only to consume its stream of utility, but also in the hope that its value will increase and it will be resellable.

What lessons does this give us for social media?

Memes become like assets when people can profit not only from 'consuming' them (i.e. paying attention and using the knowledge) but also from 'reselling' (i.e. becoming an influencer). There's an anology to asset markets in the way that political groups (to some extent knowingly) 'buy' conspiracy theories because they can then 'resell' those conspiracy theories to others and increase their own cachet in a kind of pyramid scheme. If I'm an influencer (or politician), and I think all this 'QAnon' stuff is going to increase in popularity, then I can associate myself with it even if I think it's a load of nonsense, because I will profit from its rise, and the meme will profit from my patronage. This is a meme equivalent to an asset bubble. And in fact, assets in a bubble themselves are a kind of meme (cf. 'meme stocks').

A way to reduce that would be to dampen the ability to profit from being associated with powerful memes. The meme then only has use value, and no resale value. However, the trade-off would be that this removes one of the main incentives for people to specialise in seeking out and amplifying good memes. The profession of journalist is older than, but not dissimilar to, the profession of influencer. Asset markets are unstable, but they are a powerful discovery and support mechanism (for example with businesses).

Like the market for houses and the market for cars, 'assetisation' increases when the supply of a good is constrained, so that appreciation due to rising demand outpaces depreciation due to wearing out. In the case of memes, the supply constraint isn't as clear. But does this suggest the importance of balancing appreciation against depreciation?  To design a way for memes to have a 'sell by' date? Another way to balance appreciation against costs is to make holding an asset costly, which increases use and reduces speculative holding. For example in the case of cars, assetisation is limited by the fact that owning cars has costs associated with it. Yet another way is by making holding an asset more risky, such as for example by making the asset holder more accountable for the externalities of the asset, or by introducing bubble-popping mechanisms that convincingly reveal the fundamental value of assets.

There does appear to be a supply constraint of some kind in action with memes. Of course, memes themselves are not supply constrained, but something to do with the network effects of social media means that memes crowd each other out, which leads to an 'illusion of choice' situation where each user only has access to a limited number of memes, even though there is an infinite supply of memes s/he can't access. Does this network effect contribute to the assetisation of memes?

### Variables in a social media


* The importance of various factors in the curation mechanism: sometimes the network is most important (e.g. WhatsApp/Facebook); sometimes personal preferences or search (e.g. Pinterest); sometimes peers' votes (Twitter); sometimes advertising/influencers (e.g. TikTok)
* Sometimes content is demarcated into different types with different tiers of importance -- commonly 'posts' are more important than 'replies' and are a different type of media (videos vs text). Sometimes there is little difference between posts and replies (.e.g. Twitter)
* Sometimes there is highly structured voting/rating with a strong role in curation (e.g. Pol.is), other times it's just politeness
* Differences in emergent norms and practices: eg. retweeting; dunk tweeting; remixing videos; hash tags; reels; overlaying non-matching video and narration in TikTok


### What would a good social media market look like?

* Transparent, effective, incentive-compatible curation algorithm
* does not lead to large asymmetries in social ties/ network centrality
* Formalised ways to test consensus and test against facts
* Stabilising mechanisms to disincentivise holding and speculation
* Sybil and bot robustness
* Plurality rewarding
* Does not have negative features of an asset market
